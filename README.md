Welcome to Vehicles! 
The code holds data for certain vehicles like the name, tank, speed,and more.
There are several classes. Vehicle class, which is extended by the Cars class, Truck class, which extends Cars, and rCar (raceCar) that also extends cars.
The Quiz class gets a user input and quizzes the user on the speeds of all the cars added in the constructor of the main class. 
Special features include the amount of cylinders being based off of the speed of the car. And how a car can only race if the speed is above 215 mph.
To play, press the arrow in the top right corner. Then enter what you think the speed is. It will tell you if your input is too high or too low.
Keep guessing until you get it or press 0 to quit.
